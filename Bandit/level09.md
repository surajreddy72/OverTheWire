Tried 
```
cat data.txt
```
then saw a lot of shit coming 

so used the commands given there 

tried ``` cat data.txt| uniq ```

did not work and got to know that uniq only checks the lines which are adjacent soo sorted the lines in ascending using sort
```
cat data.txt | sort | uniq
```

No Use then saw went to see uniq --help

For unique lines append -u 
```
cat data.txt|sort|uniq -u
```
